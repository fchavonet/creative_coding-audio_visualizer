# Audio Visualizer

## Description

This project is an interactive web-based audio visualizer built with the Web Audio API and Canvas.

It captures real-time audio from your microphone and displays a circular animation that reacts dynamically to sound frequencies.

## Objectives

- Capture and analyze real-time audio from the microphone.
- Render a circular bar-style visualizer using the Canvas API.
- Strengthen JavaScript skills in audio processing and animation.
